This project involves developing a web and mobile application for managing events within a school.

--> This project aims to develop a comprehensive web and mobile application for managing events within a school setting. The application facilitates event organization by allowing student organizers to submit event proposals, which can then be reviewed and approved or rejected by a designated manager. Key functionalities of the project include:

1. Authentication Page with Role-Based Access
   
      . New users can register by providing their username, mail password, role (either event requester or manager), phone number, and email.
      . Users can authenticate by entering their username and password. They can log in and log out of their accounts.
   
3. Organizer Dashboard
   
      . Users with the role of event requester can create event proposals.
      . To create a new proposal, users must fill out a form including event title, description, organizing committee, event type (competition, celebration, etc.), start and end dates,   
           required resources (venue, financial support, etc.).
      . Request status (pending, accepted, rejected) must be displayed.
      . Users can view a list of their submitted proposals (including request ID, purpose, transportation needs, date, and status) and can also log out of their accounts.
   
4. Manager Dashboard
   
Managers have the authority to review and process event proposals by accepting or rejecting them.

Managers can search for specific proposals based on different criteria.

5. Conclusion :
   
    -->  This project streamlines the process of organizing school events by providing a user-friendly platform for submitting, reviewing, and managing event requests. It promotes 
            transparency and efficiency within the school community by allowing clear communication and decision-making between event organizers and managers.
            The application will enhance collaboration and organization within the school environment, ultimately fostering a more seamless event planning process.
